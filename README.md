## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- Internet connection (for CDN resources)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/General-Aerodynamic-Forces.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd General-Aerodynamic-Forces
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser:
   ```bash
   start index.html  # On Windows

   xdg-open index.html  # On Linux
   ```

   Or simply double-click the `index.html` file in your file explorer.

## 🛠️ How to Use

### Flight Simulation
1. **Adjust Flight Controls**
   - Use the sliders to modify:
     - Angle of Attack
     - Engine Power
     - Weight Distribution

2. **Understand the Forces**
   - Toggle between different force visualizations
   - Observe how changes affect the aircraft's behavior
   - Read the real-time force balance indicators

3. **Learning Mode**
   - Access educational content about each force
   - Take interactive quizzes to test your understanding
   - Watch explanatory videos

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Frontend**
  - HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
  - [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling
  - [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) for interactive simulations
  - [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for icons

- **Deployment**
  - Static website (no server required)
  - Can be hosted on any static web hosting service (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.)

## 📚 Learning Resources

### The Four Forces of Flight
1. **Lift** - The upward force that counteracts gravity
2. **Weight** - The downward force due to gravity
3. **Thrust** - The forward force produced by the engines
4. **Drag** - The air resistance that opposes the aircraft's motion

### Key Concepts
- Bernoulli's Principle
- Angle of Attack
- Airfoil Design
- Stability and Control
- Flight Dynamics
